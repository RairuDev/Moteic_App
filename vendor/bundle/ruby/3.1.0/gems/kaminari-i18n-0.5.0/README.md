# kaminari-i18n

A ruby translation project for [kaminari](https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari) managed on [Locale](http://www.localeapp.com/) that's open to all!

## Contributing to kaminari-i18n

- Edit the translations directly on the [kaminari-i18n](http://www.localeapp.com/projects/1985) project on Locale.
- **That's it!**
- The maintainer will then pull translations from the Locale project and push to Github.

Happy translating!
